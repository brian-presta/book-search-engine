# book-search-engine
This project is a simple website that allows a user to create an account or sign in, search for books via the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books), then save books to their collection. The project uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, and uses Graph QL to handle client-to-server requests.
